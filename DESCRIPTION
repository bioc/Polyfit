Description: Polyfit is an add-on to the packages edgeR and DESeq which
        ensures the p-value distribution is uniform over the interval
        [0, 1] for data satisfying the null hypothesis of no
        differential expression, and uses an adpated Storey-Tibshiran
        method to calculate q-values.
